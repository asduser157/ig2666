        <h4>BACKSTORY: Thor is a superhero from the planet of Asgard. His adopted brother, Loki, turned evil and fights against Thor and anyone who tries to help him. Thor was the heir to his father's throne as king of Asgard, but Loki tricked Odin (Loki and Thor's father) into banishing Thor from Asgard, thus stranding him on Earth. Thor is able to save Earth from the threats Loki brings to the planet with the help of some newfound Earth friends -- and some old Asgardian comrades as well -- and he is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to be an Avenger. </h4>
