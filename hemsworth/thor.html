        <h3><p><u>THOR'S BACKSTORY:</u> <i>Thor is a semi-immortal superhero from the planet of Asgard. His adopted brother, Loki, turned evil and fights against Thor and anyone who tries to help him. Thor was the heir to his father's throne as king of Asgard, but Loki tricked Odin (Loki and Thor's father) into banishing Thor from Asgard, thus stranding him on Earth. Thor is able to save Earth from the threats Loki brings to the planet with the help of some newfound Earth friends -- and some old Asgardian comrades as well -- and he is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to be an Avenger.</i></p></h3>
        <h3><p><u>THOR'S POWERS:</u> <i>Thor has an indestructible hammer called Mjolnir that allowed him to defeat the lava-shooting giant that Loki sent to Earth. Thor's hammer can only be held by those whom Mjolnir believes worthy. A humanoid robot created by Iron Man and known as Vision is able to wield Thor's hammer after proving himself worthy to it. Captain America initially is able to slightly budge Thor's hammer early on, and he later becomes worthy enough to wield it with ease. Mjolnir can shoot through the air at very fast speeds, granting its wielders the power of flight. This ability also means that Thor's hammer has the potential to be used as a weapon to injure, knock out, or even kill enemies. Due to the worthiness requirement of Mjolnir, Thor also has placed his hammer on top of objects and people. Until someone worthy is able to move the hammer off, the person or object remains stuck there. Thor used this tactic against Loki to keep him from fighting while Thor fought the other enemies. Thor's hammer can also be called back to him -- this is very useful in situations where Thor is unable to reach his hammer and he needs to use it immediately. Mjolnir also holds the power of lightning, so in certain instances Thor can slam his hammer against the ground and the blast force will blow his enemies back while potentially electrocuting them.</i></p></h3>
        <h3><p><u>THOR'S UNDERRATEDNESS:</u> <i>Thor is often overlooked because Superman, Captain America, The Hulk, Batman, and Spider-Man are often considered better. True, Spider-Man is really close, but Thor truly is the best superhero. I mean, what could be better than a superstrong, handsome, all-powerful, and worthy man with an awesome accent? Thor really is an extraordinary superhero.</i></p></h3>
